# Radiocarbon reservoir effect off Peru and Chile during last 12 Kys BP

## Introduction
It is well-known as specific biogeochesmistry conditions regional effect on carbon 14 isotope. It is important to estimate this effect for dating tool which estimate to radiocarbon age during last 50 Kyrs in several areas research. In this work I update values of marine radiocarbon age (MRA) according to calibrated curve (MARINE20 & SHCAL20). Also I focus on MRA relationship with space-time variables (lattitude, longittude , calibrated age and uncertainty age).

## Materials and methods

In this work is trying to estimate local radiocarbon reservoir effect off (\Delta$ R) Peru to Chile during last 12 Kyrs BP. Therefore, I had found out several previously estimations. I merged 181 pairs (Marine and terrestrial samples).
