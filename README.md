# Radiocarbon reservoir off Peru and Chile during last 12 Kys BP

## Introduction
It is well-known as regional effect on carbon 14 isotope on to specific biogeochesmistry conditions. It is important to estimate this effect for radiocarbonb dating.
Radiocarbon dating is reliable tool for estimate to radiocarbon age during last 50 Kyrs in several areas research. In this work I update values of marine radiocarbon age (MRA)
according to calibrated curve (MARINE20 & SHCAL20). Also I focus on MRA relationship with space-time variables (lattitude, longittude , calibrated age and uncertainty age).
